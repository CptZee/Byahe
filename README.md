The story of "Byahe" unfolds within the picturesque province of Batangas, Philippines, primarily because of its rich historical landmarks. Batangas boasts a tapestry of historical significance that provides a compelling backdrop for the game's narrative. These landmarks, each with its own unique story, serve as the cornerstone of the player's exploration journey.

In Batangas, players embark on an educational adventure, uncovering the deep-rooted history and cultural heritage of the region. The province is adorned with landmarks that bear witness to centuries of heritage, from colonial-era churches like the Basilica of St. Martin de Tours in Taal to the historical significance of the Taal Volcano.

Batangas's diverse landscape, encompassing mountains, beaches, and lush countryside, lends itself perfectly to the gameplay. Players traverse these terrains, soaking in the beauty of their surroundings while learning about the historical importance of each location.

The decision to center the game in Batangas also aligns with its emphasis on managing a tourist guide office and souvenir shop. This business venture becomes a natural extension of the travel theme, allowing players to immerse themselves in Batangas's tourism industry while financing their journey.

Furthermore, by anchoring the story in Batangas, the game effortlessly infuses local flavor, traditions, and even Tagalog language into its narrative. Players are enveloped in the authentic culture and atmosphere of the province, enriching their gaming experience.

As players explore Batangas's historical landmarks, they embark on a journey of discovery and cultural preservation. The game not only entertains but also educates, shedding light on the profound significance of these landmarks and contributing to the preservation and promotion of Batangas's cultural and historical heritage.

## Game Objective
The primary aim of this game is to showcase these remarkable landmarks and share the untold stories that bring them to life. As you navigate through various challenges and levels, you'll have the opportunity to explore these sites, learn interesting facts, and perhaps even get a glimpse into Batangas' past. The game is divided into two parts, the byahe (travel) stage and the tour stage.  The byahe stage is composed of an action packed arcade-like stage where the player will have to avoid obstacles in the road. Meanwhile the tour level is composed of a strategy money making tycoon format. The player will have to talk to NPCs and even setup their own shops to gain money to refill their gas in order to travel again.
